# Overview
In the second year of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto St.George campus, ECE244 is a course aims for students to learn the basics of C++ programming. This project is one of the labs of this course.<br/>

This C++ program implements a parser to receive and process user inputs, handle some exceptions and uses linked lists to create a database storing information about objects. User can create, remove, move an object or a whole list from one pool to another pool of linked lists and also read or delete some or all data.

## Contact ME
If you are interested in the source code or the original documentations, please do contact me through my email kevintian.li@mail.utoronto.ca or kevin.li20021106@gmail.com. You have to prove that you are not a current ECE244 student since this will be an academic integrity issue. If you are, try to think and code it yourself as it will be a great practice to improve your software engineering skills; though if you have any questions, feel free to share it with me!
